# Candidate List App
This application is a simple web application for registering Candidate/Applicant. There is a simple form with curriculum uploading.

### Technolgy Stack
For the backend I used Springboot, and Spring Data JPA to build its Restfull API. With Springboot and Spring Data JPA everything has become easier, simple and fast to create the Restfull API. 
For the database I used Mysql and I used Hikari Connection Pooling to get better performance. 

At the front end I used bootstrap and angularjs. With bootstrap it is more easy to create a good looking and responsive website, and with angularjs it will help me alot with the data binding and on API calling, everything becomes simple. Webjars I used to simplify the javascript library package. With web jar we will not bother with client-side dependencies. 
And for the web analytics, I used [Quixxi](https://quixxi.com/). Quixxi is very easy to use, we can record any event we want.
